A Brutalist HTML Webpage for Recipes

This project is designed to showcase basic-level HTML knowledge and competency through the creation of a small website to showcase recipes. CSS is not present in this project, and is considered a 'brutalist' variant of web-design for code-showcase.

Once completed, this will highlight core understanding of HTML.
