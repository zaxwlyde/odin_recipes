    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Enjoyed by the millions, there's nothing like coming home after a long day to a warm bowl of cheesy goodness. Get ready to boil, stir, and bake an enjoyable meal of Mac'N'Cheese. </p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This recipe uses a high amount of <strong>fats, cheese, and gluten products</strong> to create a delicious bowl of mac'n'cheese. If you've suffered digestive issues with these ingredients in the past, <em>we wouldn't</em> recommend this recipe for you.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. of dried elbow pasta.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of unsalted butter.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of all purpose flour.</li>
        <li>1 and a 1/2 cups of whole milk.</li>
        <li>2 and a 1/2 cups of half and half</li>
        <li>4 cups of shredded medium sharp cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>2 cups of shredded Gruyere cheese.</li>
        <li>1/2 a tablespoon of salt.</li>
        <li>1/2 a tablespoon of black pepper.</li>
        <li>1/4th a tablespoon of paprika.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F, continue with step 2 while you wait.</li>
        <li>Grease a 3 qt baking dish, and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Using a large pot of salted water, boil it. While you're boiling, add the dried pasta, and cook for a minute less than the package directs. This is intentional. Ensure it's drained and drizzled with a small amount of olive oil to keep it from getting sticky.</li>
        <li>While the water's boiling, shred those cheeses and toss them together to make a healthy mix. Divide them into three piles. You're going to make roughly 3 cups worth for the sauce, roughly 1 and a 1/2 cups for the inner layer, and roughly 1 and a 1/2 cups for the topping.</li>
        <li>Next up, things might get messy. Melt some butter in a large saucepan over the <strong>'Medium'</strong> heat setting. Sprinkle in some flour and whisk it to combine, this'll make the mixture look like wet sand. Then, cook it for approximately 1 minute, ensuring you whisk it often.</li>
        <li><strong>Slowly</strong> pour in about 2 cups or so of the milk and half & half while whisking nonstop until it's smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Slowly</strong> pour in the remaining milk and half & half, while whisking nonstop until they're combined and smooth again.</li>
        <li>Continue to heat it over the <strong>'Medium'</strong> heat setting, and whisk it quite often until it thickens out to quite the thick consistency. To be safe, the consistency should be close to a semi thinned out variant of a condensed soup.</li>
        <li>Remove it from the heat, and stir in your spices and 1 and a 1/2 cups of the cheeses. Then, stir it to melt and combine them.</li>
        <li>Stir in another 1 and a 1/2 cups of cheese, and stir until completely melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>Now, using a large mixing bowl; combine the drained pasta with your cheese sauce, stirring it to combine the two fully.</li>
        <li>Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top it with 1 and a 1/2 cups of shredded cheeses, then top that with the remaining pasta mixture.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with the last 1 and a 1/2 cups of cheese, bake it for 15 minutes, and ensure the cheese is bubbly and lightly golden brown.</li>
        <li>Last but not least, the best part! Let it cool slightly, serve it up, and enjoy!</li>
