    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An all-time favorite for the family to enjoy. Get ready to sink your hands into some dough, smatter some sauce, melt delicious cheese, and delicately place slices of cut pepperoni!</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This recipe uses a high amount of <strong>fats, cheese, and gluten products</strong> to create a delicious pepperoni pizza. If you've suffered digestive issues with these ingredients in the past, <em>we wouldn't</em> recommend this recipe for you.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 oz pizza dough, this can be bought at the store, or made at home.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of pizza sauce.</li>
        <li>18 to 20 slices of pepperoni.</li>
        <li>12 ounces of grated mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of fresh oregano.</li>
        <li>Flour for rolling and shaping the dough.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500Â°F.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough on a surface that's lightly floured. If rolling the dough is difficult, let it rest for roughly five minutes to reach room temperature.</li>
        <li>Using a lightly dusted pizza peel, shift the dough over.</li>
        <li>Add sauce lightly around the pizza, leaving roughly 1/4th inches of crust around the edges.</li>
        <li>Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Then, top the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni, before seasoning with black pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook your pizza for 6 minutes, then rotate it halfway for an even cooking. Proceed to cook the pizza for another 6 to 8 minutes, or until your crust is golden brown.</li>
        <li>The best part! Slide the pizza out, let it rest for a minute, and slice and dice your way to a delicious meal!</li>
    </ol>
